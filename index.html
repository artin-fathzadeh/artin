However, what I enjoy even more is annoying people with Curious George (it's highly effective).</p><p style="animation-delay:28s">----------------------</p><p style="animation-delay:30s">I also like annoying people with the truth, aka the fact Microsoft Bing is better than Google. (If you use any search engine other than Google, it almost always runs on Bing (ex - Duckduckgo runs on Bing), and that's good because Bing has the least government censorship so if you're trying to overtake the U.S. government, Bing is the place to start! Also, Bing is privacy respecting and by that I mean it still takes all your data but it takes less than Google. Also, I have to use Bing because I have a Windows device and if I don't use Bing and Microsoft Edge (Firefox is op) I get 500 annoying popups per second saying to use "Microsoft's Recommended Settings", so use Bing so you don't have to go through "Microsoft's Recommended Settings".</p><p style="animation-delay:67s">----------------------</p><p style="animation-delay:69s">Also, I'm extremely biased against Microsoft because I practically use all their products (Yes, even WSL - 0 pickles out of 10 hotdog stands, barely worked) so if you ask me who the best company is I will always say Microsoft. However, the best non-profit in my extremely biased opinion is Apache (.org) or possibly Mozilla.</p><p style="animation-delay:85s">----------------------</p><p style="animation-delay:87s">I also like computer science, specifically cybersecurity but I still don't know how to exit Vim (It's impossible)</p><p style="animation-delay:93s">----------------------</p><p style="animation-delay:95s">Also, Pugs are the best dogs and are better than cats. Some cats are better than some dogs though. For example, Persian Cats (And not because I'm Persian, however, there are lots of Persian Cats on the streets of Iran though, you can't walk 2 blocks without seeing one) are better than some dogs. But Pugs are better than all cats and all other dogs.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; But Lemurs are the best animals (search blue-eyed lemur or bushbaby lemur).</p><p style="animation-delay:123s">----------------------</p><p style="animation-delay:125s">ALSO, I know I said 'also' too many times but few people will even see this (if any) so it doesn't - watter wow many gwammatwicwal errwors ei waide-(matter how many grammatical errors I made)</p><p style="animation-delay:138s">----------------------</p><p style="animation-delay:140s">Why did I do all of this? I figured that my profile was so cringe and needed to be hidden but it was too sus have an empty profile so I pulled a Sam Loyd, that and the fact that it allowed you to understand me better than just reading my profile and allowed you to see how annoying i am.</p><p style="animation-delay:160s">Why this symbol-␗. Why out of all the Unicode symbols did I choose this-␗, I had many reasons but I'll keep it to 3. Firstly the last 4 letters spell out 'lock', symbolizing the encryption I used. Secondly&nbsp;␗ stands for&nbsp;end of transmission block, it was always interesting to me how computers knew when a message ended, just like how I always wondered how you could encrypt things through the internet without sending the key when I was little (now I know it uses public and private keys). The final reason being that its a widely supported Unicode character, not all Unicode characters are supported everywhere, and while some are, some aren't and since I needed to use the symbol I chose in many places, it needed to be very widely supported.</p><p style="animation-delay:195s">How does it work? If you really want to learn how it works I have linked the source code below (It's on GitHub but if you're unable to access it I can also give you the Gitlab or Bitbucket hosted code page), but as a short summary, the code is hosted on Github which connects to Cloudflare and hosts the website (& DNS). I chose GitHub over Gitlab because it was the easiest to use and I have an active subscription to GitHub and chose Cloudflare as I had no reason to self-host it as I appreciate my time and don't feel like spending 13 hours trying to setup Azure (yes, I use Azure and not AWS, as I stated previously I use ALL Microsoft products).</p><p class="branding" style="font-size:3.225vw;line-height:3.225vw;animation-delay:2.1s"><a href="https://github.com/artin-fathzadeh" target="_blank">source code</a></p></div><button id="editcontent-button" onclick="window.location.href = '/editor'" class="editcontent-button" data-title="Edit&nbsp;page" style="display:none;margin-bottom:0;position:fixed;right:10px;bottom:10px;justify-content:center;align-items:center"><svg style="stroke-width:.5;margin-left:1.25px" ;="" width="26" height="26" viewBox="0 0 24 24" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path stroke="currentColor" fill="currentColor" d="M22 7.24a1 1 0 0 0-.29-.71l-4.24-4.24a1 1 0 0 0-.71-.29a1 1 0 0 0-.71.29l-2.83 2.83L2.29 16.05a1 1 0 0 0-.29.71V21a1 1 0 0 0 1 1h4.24a1 1 0 0 0 .76-.29l10.87-10.93L21.71 8a1.19 1.19 0 0 0 .22-.33a1 1 0 0 0 0-.24a.7.7 0 0 0 0-.14ZM6.83 20H4v-2.83l9.93-9.93l2.83 2.83ZM18.17 8.66l-2.83-2.83l1.42-1.41l2.82 2.82Z"></path></svg></button><script>(async () => {
